    Pull ACPI updates from Rafael Wysocki:
     "The new feaures here are the support for ACPI overlays (allowing ACPI
      tables to be loaded at any time from EFI variables or via configfs)
      and the LPI (Low-Power Idle) support.  Also notable is the ACPI-based
      NUMA support for ARM64.
    
      Apart from that we have two new drivers, for the DPTF (Dynamic Power
      and Thermal Framework) power participant device and for the Intel
      Broxton WhiskeyCove PMIC, some more PMIC-related changes, support for
      the Boot Error Record Table (BERT) in APEI and support for
      platform-initiated graceful shutdown.
    
      Plus two new pieces of documentation and usual assorted fixes and
      cleanups in quite a few places.
    
      Specifics:
    
       - Support for ACPI SSDT overlays allowing Secondary System
         Description Tables (SSDTs) to be loaded at any time from EFI
         variables or via configfs (Octavian Purdila, Mika Westerberg).
    
       - Support for the ACPI LPI (Low-Power Idle) feature introduced in
         ACPI 6.0 and allowing processor idle states to be represented in
         ACPI tables in a hierarchical way (with the help of Processor
         Container objects) and support for ACPI idle states management on
         ARM64, based on LPI (Sudeep Holla).
    
       - General improvements of ACPI support for NUMA and ARM64 support for
         ACPI-based NUMA (Hanjun Guo, David Daney, Robert Richter).
    
       - General improvements of the ACPI table upgrade mechanism and ARM64
         support for that feature (Aleksey Makarov, Jon Masters).
    
       - Support for the Boot Error Record Table (BERT) in APEI and
         improvements of kernel messages printed by the error injection code
         (Huang Ying, Borislav Petkov).
    
       - New driver for the Intel Broxton WhiskeyCove PMIC operation region
         and support for the REGS operation region on Broxton, PMIC code
         cleanups (Bin Gao, Felipe Balbi, Paul Gortmaker).
    
       - New driver for the power participant device which is part of the
         Dynamic Power and Thermal Framework (DPTF) and DPTF-related code
         reorganization (Srinivas Pandruvada).
    
       - Support for the platform-initiated graceful shutdown feature
         introduced in ACPI 6.1 (Prashanth Prakash).
    
       - ACPI button driver update related to lid input events generated
         automatically on initialization and system resume that have been
         problematic for some time (Lv Zheng).
    
       - ACPI EC driver cleanups (Lv Zheng).
    
       - Documentation of the ACPICA release automation process and the
         in-kernel ACPI AML debugger (Lv Zheng).
    
       - New blacklist entry and two fixes for the ACPI backlight driver
         (Alex Hung, Arvind Yadav, Ralf Gerbig).
    
       - Cleanups of the ACPI pci_slot driver (Joe Perches, Paul Gortmaker).
    
       - ACPI CPPC code changes to make it more robust against possible
         defects in ACPI tables and new symbol definitions for PCC (Hoan
         Tran).
    
       - System reboot code modification to execute the ACPI _PTS (Prepare
         To Sleep) method in addition to _TTS (Ocean He).
    
       - ACPICA-related change to carry out lock ordering checks in ACPICA
         if ACPICA debug is enabled in the kernel (Lv Zheng).
    
       - Assorted minor fixes and cleanups (Andy Shevchenko, Baoquan He,
         Bhaktipriya Shridhar, Paul Gortmaker, Rafael Wysocki)"

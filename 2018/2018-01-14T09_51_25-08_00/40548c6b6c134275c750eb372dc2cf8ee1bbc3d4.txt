    Merge branch 'x86-pti-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip
    
    Pull x86 pti updates from Thomas Gleixner:
     "This contains:
    
       - a PTI bugfix to avoid setting reserved CR3 bits when PCID is
         disabled. This seems to cause issues on a virtual machine at least
         and is incorrect according to the AMD manual.
    
       - a PTI bugfix which disables the perf BTS facility if PTI is
         enabled. The BTS AUX buffer is not globally visible and causes the
         CPU to fault when the mapping disappears on switching CR3 to user
         space. A full fix which restores BTS on PTI is non trivial and will
         be worked on.
    
       - PTI bugfixes for EFI and trusted boot which make sure that the user
         space visible page table entries have the NX bit cleared
    
       - removal of dead code in the PTI pagetable setup functions
    
       - add PTI documentation
    
       - add a selftest for vsyscall to verify that the kernel actually
         implements what it advertises.
    
       - a sysfs interface to expose vulnerability and mitigation
         information so there is a coherent way for users to retrieve the
         status.
    
       - the initial spectre_v2 mitigations, aka retpoline:
    
          + The necessary ASM thunk and compiler support
    
          + The ASM variants of retpoline and the conversion of affected ASM
            code
    
          + Make LFENCE serializing on AMD so it can be used as speculation
            trap
    
          + The RSB fill after vmexit
    
       - initial objtool support for retpoline
    
      As I said in the status mail this is the most of the set of patches
      which should go into 4.15 except two straight forward patches still on
      hold:
    
       - the retpoline add on of LFENCE which waits for ACKs
    
       - the RSB fill after context switch
    
      Both should be ready to go early next week and with that we'll have
      covered the major holes of spectre_v2 and go back to normality"
